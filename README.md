# Nethack-3.4.3-js

This is my attempt to port [nethack-3.4.3](http://www.nethack.org/) to the web with [Emscripten](http://emscripten.org/).

The first commits contain the modifications on top of the vanilla nethack to make it compile on my machine (Ubuntu 14.04, and the gcc (later clang) that ships with it)

Any kind of volunteering and contribution is highly appreciated.
I am completely new to Emscripten and the Nethack code base.
