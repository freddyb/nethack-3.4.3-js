this is a feeble attempt to build nethack for the web with emscripten.
the first commits contain the modifications on top of the vanilla nethack to
make it compile on my machine (linux, 64bit, pretty recent gcc)

Any kind of volunteering and contribution is highly appreciated.
I am completely new to emscripten and the nethack code base.
